Problem Statement: QuickBites Food Delivery App
People today are increasingly busy and lead time-constrained lives. Juggling work, family, and social commitments often leaves little time for cooking elaborate meals at home. While takeout and delivery options exist, finding the right restaurant with a user-friendly online ordering system and real-time delivery tracking can be a challenge. Additionally, scattered information across various restaurant websites makes it difficult to compare menus, prices, and user reviews in one place.
